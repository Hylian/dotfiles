# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,

# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

# The value of ctrl+super is used as the modifier for all default shortcuts, you

# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
#
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+super+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout
#
# You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below:
# map key1>key2>key3 action
# For example:
# map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20
# this will change the font size to 20 points when you press ctrl+f and then 2

# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
